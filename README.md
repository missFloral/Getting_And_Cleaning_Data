Introduction

This repository is my work for the course project in Coursera "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.

About repo files
----------------
`CodeBook.md` describes explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains the full code to perform the 5 cleaning steps, with additional information about the detailed instruction. 

The output of the 5th step is called `Mean.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
